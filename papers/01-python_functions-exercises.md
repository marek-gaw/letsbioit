# Exercise 01
Implement a function named `square` that will return a given argument to the power of 2.

_Tip_

- `**` is the power operator in python.
```python
# Calculate 2 to the power of 3
2 ** 3  
# Calculate 4 to the power of 3
# and assign the result to the variable a
a = 4 ** 3  
```

# Exercise 02
Write a function `my_sum` that takes a list of numbers as an argument and return their sum.

_Tip_

- Lists in python are declared as a comma separated sequences in square brackets.
- Lists can be iterated over with a `for` loop.
- List can consist of any type of values.

```python
list_of_numbers = [1, 2, 3]
list_of_words = ['dog', 'cat', 'apple']
other_list = [1, 2, 'd', 1.3, None, True]

for num in list_of_numbers:
    print(num)

# Result:
# 1
# 2
# 3
```
