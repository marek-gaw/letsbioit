# Exercise 01
Define a class `Vehicle`.
Each vehicle instance should have following attributes:
    - production_year
    - make

_Tips_
- remember that instance attributes must be defined inside the `__init__()` function.

# Exercise 02
## Step 1
Define classes `Car` and `Truck`.
Both should extend the class `Vehicle`.

## Step 2
Define additional attribute `color` that will be available in each `Car` instance.

## Step 3
Define additional attribute `max_load` that will be available in each `Truck` instance.

## Step 4
Define a method `repaint()` for each `Car` instance.
This method should take a single argument - the color name and change the value of the `color` attribute of the instance.
